Homework 1: Code Refactor

ðŸŒŸObjectives for the assignment : We are given a base code (index.html) along with its linked style sheet and our 
goal is to successfully change the HTML tags in the documents in order to add semantic meaning when relevant.

ðŸŒŸWithin this repository you will find my corrected index.html file with semantic tags added as well as a linked
stylesheet that is also corrected.

ðŸŒŸThe task is to change the non semantic tags to semantic tags to better understand the importance of organization and clarity when working collaboratively.
